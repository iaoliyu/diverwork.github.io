2. ** Robotic Arm End-effector** In the structural design of the hand claw, the mechanism is simple to facilitate expansion and installation, and the light weight is to improve the load capacity of the mechanical arm, thereby improving the working efficiency of the entire mechanical arm.

3. **Analysis of motion planning of mechanical arm ** A rotating motor is provided for the three elbow joints of the manipulator to demonstrate the rotation from the initial position to the specified position
