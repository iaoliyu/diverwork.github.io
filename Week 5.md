        <dt>Fifth Week Schedule</dt>
        <dd>The group held a meeting at 1:30 p.m. on 22 September. This week we optimized the details of the project design and discussed each section with our mentor. 


<dd>
1. ** Opening Equipment: **

The three-dimensional diagram is designed and the tool structure and feed structure are optimized.
<dd>
2. ** Robotic Arm End-effector**

Write sensor code and select sensor types. The FSR402 is a resistive pressure sensor. It is allowed to be used in the occasion of pressure 100g-10kg. It can be used to detect the end of the mechanical gripper.




<dd>
3. **Analysis of motion planning of mechanical arm **
The connecting flange of the mechanical arm is connected with the small hole in the center of the base.
Four lifting points are set at the four corners of the base to increase the stability of the robotic arm.




<dd>
4. **Analysis of motion planning of mechanical arm **
The stress of the assembly of the single-axis inclined structure is calculated, and the stress of the six-axis robot is simulated by software.



<dd>
5. **Equipment Automation**
Determine the approximate hole punching position using the hole punching device.
Taking photos of fuel tanks with an underwater camera.
Analyze the image with Matlab to determine the proper location of the hole punch.
Determine the appropriate coordinates for the opening position and move the opening device into place.
