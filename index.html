Today's world is becoming increasingly busy with maritime transportation, which is inevitably accompanied by the occurrence of maritime accidents and the risk of oil spill pollution. This potential pollution can have a huge impact on the safety of the marine environment. To solve this risk, we plan to design an underwater open-hole oil pumping device for shipwrecks. This device can utilize underwater drilling tools to drill holes in the residual oil compartments, and then pump the residual oil directly out of the wreck and transfer it to a safe vessel using a pumping unit.</p>
