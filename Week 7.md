        <dt>Seventh Week Schedule</dt>
        <dd>The group held a meeting at 1:30 p.m. on 3 October. This week we optimized the details of the project design and discussed each section with our mentor. 


<dd>
1. ** Opening Equipment: **

This week, I designed a structure that makes a group (two) ball screw feed for two tools. The barrel knife for opening the hole and the three drill bits for positioning are installed at both ends of the slide table on the ball screw. When the tool at one end completes the work, the whole equipment is rotated to make the ball screw feed in reverse, so that the other end continues to work.

2. ** Robotic Arm End-effector**

The drive system of the end effector is divided into three categories according to the power source: pneumatic, hydraulic and electric, and these three types can also be composed of a compound drive system according to needs.




<dd>
3. **Analysis of motion planning of mechanical arm **
The robot weighs about 2400kg
Buoyancy is calculated at 6000N
The weight of the counterweight and kit is about 5kg
The mass of the end effector is approximately 8kg




<dd>
4. **Profile Design**
Fluid analysis of the motion state of joint 2,3 at a 2m/s velocity in the y direction when rotated 90 degrees.

5. **Equipment Automation**
<dd>
1)Punching and positioning using a positioning device
<dd>
2)Screening for compliant opening locations
<dd>
3)Rotation of hole-opening equipment using a robotic arm
<dd>
4)Opening of holes using a milling cutter
