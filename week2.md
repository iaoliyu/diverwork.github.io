 During our first meeting with the teacher this week, we discussed three different graduation design projects with our supervisor, analyzed the strengths and weaknesses of each project, and finally synthesized everyone's ideas. Our group chose the exoskeleton robot project. During the second meeting, the instructor assigned us tasks before the next meeting, and our group also divided the work and discussed various forms of exoskeleton robots with the instructor.
